<h1>What are those??</h1>
<p>Some achievements are hard, some are easy, but first you will want to know what they are!</p>
<p>The GetPlayerAchievements call uses three arguements to give you details about a games achievements and player completion.</p>
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<ul>
<li>appid--The id of the game you want to look at</li>
<li>key-- your api key that you got on the api key page</li>
<li>steamid=the id of your steam id or a players steam id.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Call</h2>
<span><p>http://http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserStats/GetPlayerAchievements/v0001/?appid=48700&key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&steamid=76561197972495328</p></span>
<p>The key has to be your own api key(or someone elses, but i cant endorse stealing) This will give you an output looking something like this:</p>

<p>The data listed has four outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>steamID-- the user id that is accessing</li>
<li>gameName--The Game name... Simply states the game</li>
<li>apiname--the name of the achievement in steams naming system</li>
<li>achieved--1= achieved 0=not achieved</li>
</ul>
<p>There seems to be missing data on some games so you may want to be careful with how you set up your parsing and make sure it has a no information option.</p>
