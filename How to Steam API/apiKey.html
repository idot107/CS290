<h1>Lets get set up!</h1><br>
<p>Before we get started using Steams API we first have to obtain a API Key from steam.</p><br>
<p>To obtain the Steam API Key begin by going to Steams API Key site located here: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/login/home/?goto=%2Fdev%2Fapikey">Steam API Key</a></p><br>

<p>Now that we have our API key we can begin to explore the numerous possiblilities of the Steam API!</p>
